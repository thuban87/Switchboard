# Switchboard Feature Brainstorming
*Generated by Gemini - January 18, 2026*

This document outlines "fun and productive" features to enhance the Switchboard plugin, leaning into the telephone operator metaphor while solving real workflow friction.

## 1. "The Click" (Audio Feedback) 🔊
**Theme:** *Fun / Immersion*
**Concept:** Add satisfying, high-quality mechanical sound effects to plugin actions.
- **Patch In:** A heavy "clunk" or 1/4" jack plugging in.
- **Incoming Call:** A quiet, non-annoying vintage ringer.
- **Disconnect:** A "plug-out" or "click" sound.
- **Implementation:** Simple `Audio` object usage. Add a "Mute" toggle in settings for quiet environments.
**Why:** Makes the context switch feel *physical* and deliberate. Provides a small dopamine hit for starting work.

## 2. "Call Waiting" (Smart Decline) 📼
**Theme:** *Productivity / Anxiety Reduction*
**Concept:** Currently, "Decline" just dismisses the modal. "Call Waiting" ensures the task isn't lost.
- When you decline a call, prompt: "Send to Call Waiting?"
- **Action:** Moves the task (or copies it) to a specific `Call Waiting.md` file or an "Inbox" folder.
- **Advanced:** Offer quick reschedule buttons ("Call back in 1 hr", "Call back tomorrow").
**Why:** Reduces the fear of dismissing a task. "I can't do this now, but it's safe in the queue."

## 3. "Speed Dial" (Hotkeys) ⚡
**Theme:** *Productivity / Speed*
**Concept:** Bind specific Lines to command palette IDs, allowing hotkey assignment.
- **Settings:** "Add Speed Dial for [Line Name]" button.
- **Result:** Registers command `switchboard:patch-in-math`. User binds `Ctrl+Shift+1`.
**Why:** Removes the friction of opening the ribbon or menu. Muscle memory for entering focus.

## 4. "Operator's Log" (Daily Note Integration) 📓
**Theme:** *Integration*
**Concept:** In addition to the specific Session Log, add a summary to your Daily Note.
- **Format:** `[14:00 - 15:30] 📞 Focused on: Math 140 (90m)`
- **Implementation:** Look for a `## Log` or `## Timeline` heading in the daily note.
**Why:** Creates a master timeline of your entire day automatically in your primary journal.

## 5. "Busy Signal" (Conflict Handling) ⛔
**Theme:** *Metaphor*
**Concept:** If a scheduled block triggers while you are *already* patched into another line:
- Play a "Busy Signal" sound (optional).
- Show a discreet toast instead of a full modal: *"Incoming call from [Line B] - Busy."*
**Why:** Prevents breaking flow when you went overtime on a previous task.

## Deferred Features

### 6. Chronos Two-Way Sync 🔄
**Theme:** *Integration*
**Concept:** Tie Chronos and Switchboard together so manual schedules become calendar events.
- **Goal:** User creates a "Scheduled Block" in Switchboard (e.g., Math every Mon/Wed at 9am), and it creates those events in Google Calendar via Chronos.
- **Challenge:** Requires Chronos to have a "Create Event" API.
- **Logic:**
    - Manual scheduled session -> Creates Calendar Event.
    - Calendar Event -> Creates "Incoming Call" prompt.
    - Need to handle edge case of double-prompting (Switchboard knows you're already in the session).
