- [ ] Can we tie Chronos and Switchboard together somehow so that events that are manually scheduled in Switchboard get events made in calendar?
- [ ] Add timer to Switchboard so I can track how much time I spent in each session
	- [ ] Will need to handle edge case of starting a session manually and then being prompted by a scheduled session. The scheduled session should see that a session is active and if it's the same line, skip trying to start it again. If it's a different line, prompt to start.
